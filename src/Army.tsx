                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>The Republic of China Army (陆军) originated from the National Revolutionary Army of the Nationalist Chinese regime, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang (KMT) in 1924, when the Whampoa Military Academy was established with Soviet military assistance.</p>

                <p>Whampoa Military Academy, presided over by Chiang Kai-shek, was tasked with training a professional Chinese revolutionary army (革命軍人) to unify China during the Warlord Era. The army participated in the Northern Expedition to unify China in 1926, the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and, most recently, since the retreat of the ROC to Taiwan, the Battle of Kuningtou.</p>

                <p>While the ROC has retreated to the island of Taiwan, the ROC army’s main mission remains to retake the Chinese mainland from the People’s Republic of China.</p>
